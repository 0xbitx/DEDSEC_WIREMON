<h1 align="center"> WIREMON </h1>
<h4 align="center"> DEDSEC WIFI ATTACK FRAMEWORK </h4>
<h4 align="center"> WIREMON is a Linux-based wifi attack framework tool.</h4>

### Features DESCRIPTION:

   * Deauth: This feature sends deauthentication packets to disconnect clients from a specified Wi-Fi network. Useful for network testing or managing connected devices.

   * Pixie Dust: A vulnerability exploitation technique targeting WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) to recover the WPA/WPA2 passphrase from vulnerable routers. This is used to crack the network's password.

   * Packet Monitor: Captures and analyzes packets transmitted over a network. This feature allows you to inspect network traffic, identify potential security issues, and monitor communication between devices.

   * Beacon Flood: Sends out a large number of fake beacon frames to flood the airwaves with multiple SSIDs. This can confuse clients and disrupt normal network operations, often used for network testing and analysis.

   * Evil Twin: Creates a clone Wi-Fi network targeting the victim, disconnecting clients from the original network. Users who connect to the cloned Wi-Fi are redirected to a fake error page where they are prompted to enter their Wi-Fi password to "fix" the issue.
   * Reveal Hidden SSID: Uncovers hidden Wi-Fi networks that do not broadcast their SSID. This feature scans and identifies these hidden networks, making them visible for network analysis or connection attempts.

   * Reveal Wi-Fi Abuser: Dumps client data such as photos from front or face cameras through a fake captive portal page. This feature is used to capture information from users who connect to the fake network.

   * Deploy Malware: Creates a malicious page that includes malware and presents a download button. When users interact with the page, they inadvertently download and execute the malware.

   * Send Message:  Sets up a captive portal page that displays a custom message to the Wi-Fi network owner. Useful for sending notifications or alerts to users who connect to the network.

   * Rick Roll: Deploys a captive portal page that automatically plays the "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video in a loop. A fun prank to trick clients into viewing the famous Rickroll video.

Each of these features leverages various network manipulation techniques and social engineering methods for different purposes, from security testing.
